## Viewing your API Docs
To view and update your API documentation, install Optic and run `api spec`:
```
npm install @useoptic/cli -g
api spec
```

## Documenting your API with Optic
To keep your docs up to date, start your API using Optic's CLI. This lets Optic watch your API's behavior and notify you whenever the API docs get updated. 
```
# instead of using something like `npm start`, switch to our command
api start
```
