# What is Seamless 

Seamless is a toolchain for building consumable APIs. It is open source and backed by YCombinator. 

We plan to support workflow across the API lifecycle from design and testing to code generation and governance. You can help set the course of the project by sharing your insights and challenges on [GitHub]. 

## Why do I need Seamless, and what can it do today?

In July we launched the the Seamless Designer, a visual tool for designing and documenting RESTful APIs. We set out to build the simplest and most powerful editor for API specifications ([let us know if we did]). The Designer is independently useful today and serves as the front-door to the Seamless ecosystem. 

In Seamless, collaboration is at the forefront of the design process and is built into its core. A Google Drive inspired suggestion mode is coming soon to support richer collaboration and requirements gathering between teams. 

Consider using Seamless if:

- **It is difficult for your team to write and maintain accurate API specifications.**
    - Seamless makes it easy design complex APIs and mix Design-first and Code-first workflows.
- **You value better communication between all stakeholders.**
    - With Seamless, you can ask questions, make suggestions, and discuss API changes before they are made.
- **You want to enforce standards across all your APIs.**
    - Seamless allows you to design and enforce standards for things like pagination across all your APIs.
- **You are stuck on OpenAPI/Swagger 2, had difficulty upgrading to OpenAPI 3, or want a forwards-compatible API specification.**
    - Seamless assures that you can rely specification that is always forwards-compatible.

## Why

Software built today relies on more APIs than ever before. These APIs are dependencies, and managing them is magnitudes more difficult than the ease at which you can manage a code dependency. In almost every case, you get stuck writing the client code, the documentation is inadequate, and eventually a breaking change happens without your knowledge. 

We knew we would spend at least some of our time writing the glue code that holds it all together, but that *some of our time* is now measured in days per week. The total effort spent connecting the world's APIs is massive and keeps some of our best minds from solving other problems.

Developers are playing the role of human type systems caught in a never-ending cycle of writing docs, reading them, and writing glue code. We are building Seamless to handle that complexity for your team, so you can get the freedom to focus on your most important work.

## About Us

Seamless grew out of the Optic project from YCombinator's S2018 batch. We observed users applying our static analysis/code generation tools to keep their client code in sync with their APIs. We kept digging and realized almost every team faced similar challenges. We knew we could make a difference here and decided to dedicate ourselves to making the experience of connecting the world's APIs and apps seamless. 

We (Aidan Cunniffe and Dev Doshi) have both been building developer tools for most of our careers. Aidan founded Dropsource, the popular low-code platform, and took Optic through YC last year. He pioneered approaches to cross-language static analysis and training code generators from example code while building Optic. Dev is a thoughtful tool-builder who applies the methods he learned studying Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon and those he picked up during his career. He has applied his insights and design methodologies to craft successful tools in both education and developer tools. 

Seamless is a business. We do make money selling services and specialized products that help large teams manage hundreds of Seamless APIs, but we will always have an open core and a free version. If we ever renege on that promise, we ask that you raise a crowd and chase us from the village square.
