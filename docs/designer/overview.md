# Seamless API Designer

The API Designer is a visual tool for designing and documenting RESTful APIs. We set out to build the simplest and most powerful editor for API specifications â€” [let us know if we did].

Click here to try the [API Designer](https://editor.seamlessapis.com)

## Navigation
You can navigate to the specification for all the requests and concepts in your API by clicking on the down-arrow in the top-left corner of the screen (next to your API's name). You can also start a search by double-pressing the left-shift key.

You can use Seamless in either Documentation or Design mode. These modes are activated by clicking the buttons in the top right of the screen

In Documentation mode the API specification is read-only and the layout of each reference page is optimized for API consumers.

When you switch into Design mode, editors are revealed throughout the interface that let you update the API specification visually. Soon we'll be adding commenting, and a new mode for suggestions (like Google-Drive) where changes require approval from your team before being finalized.
